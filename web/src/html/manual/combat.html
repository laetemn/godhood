                        Depending on your style of play, you may find yourself engaged in combat more than once
                        during the game. If so, this handy guide will teach you the basics, so you won't
                        completely disgrace yourself.

                            You can attack just about anything in the game. If someone or something is in your
                            way, odds are a few chops from your broad sword will fix the problem. You mightn't
                            win any popularity contests for doing this, but expediency often trumps virtue in
                            this day and age.
                            <P/>
                            To attack an object you will need to select an attack from your action menu. Some
                            <A HREF="items.html">items</A> give you additional attack options, however most
                            characters will have an intrinsic attack of some description. Have a look for an
                            action with a "†" symbol after it.
                            <P/>
                            After you select this action you will enter <I>Attack</I> mode. A target will
                            appear on the screen, this will be sitting on the closest enemy who is in range.
                            You can simply press <I>Fire</I> or <I>Game A</I> to attack this monster. If
                            you wish to attack another square you can move the target to that square using
                            the direction keys on your keypad.

                            You can cancel your attack at any point by simply selecting another action to
                            perform.

                                If all this sounds a bit hard, don't worry, most of the time you can use your
                                characters default attack. You do this by simply walking into the monster you
                                wish to attack while in <I>Move</I> mode. Your character will automatically
                                select what he/she thinks is the best attack for the job.

                            Sometimes you will meet a particularly beligerent individual who means to do you
                            harm. If this does happen, it is very likely that you will find yourself under
                            attack. In <I>Godhood</I> your armour will reduce the chance that you are hit,
                            however the attackers level of experience will increase the chance that they will
                            hit you. If you are struck, you will stop what ever you are doing (casting
                            a spell, defending, sleeping, etc...) and a drop of blood will appear above
                            your head, as well as a bar indicating your health.

                            If a monster is attacked often enough he or she will eventually die. Indeed this
                            is generally the desired result of any attack. Some attacks will, in addition to
                            injuring the victim, cause the victim additional discomfort. For example, a Flaming
                            Sword, will, in addition to the damage inflicted by the sword, set the target
                            on fire!
                            <P>
                            If your character dies then the game ends.
