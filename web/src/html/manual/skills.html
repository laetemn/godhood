                            <H4>Chat</H4>
                            Talks to an adjacent monster, the monster may tell you something useful, or it
                            may ignore you entirely.
                        </A>

                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/defend.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Defend</H4>
                            While defending, your attack power is added to your defence power thus reducing the
                            chance of being hit. The drawback is that you will not attack monsters that
                            move into range.
                            If you are struck while defending then you immediately stop, and subsequent
                            attacks have a normal probability of hitting.
                            This action ends the current turn.

                            Ends the current turn.

                            Enters move mode, see the <A HREF="moving.html">movement</A> section for more
                            information.

                            <H4>Pickpocket</H4>
                            Steals an item from the target monster. The thief specialises in this action.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="pray">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/cross.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Pray</H4>
                            Prays to your characters god, the effect of this action is completely at your
                            gods discretion. The cleric has a close enough relationship with his god
                            to be able to do this.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="recruit">
                            <H4>Recruit</H4>
                            Recruits a friendly monster to your cause, this is a time consuming process and
                            only works on monsters who are weaker than you are. The cleric and the fighter
                            pride themselves on their people skills, hence can perform this action.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="sleeping">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/dazed.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Sleeping</H4>
                            Sometimes you'll be caught napping, unfortunately sleeping for a few seconds on
                            the battlefield has absolutely no benefits and is quite dangerous. Being hit
                            by another monster will wake you up, but you'll also take double damage for
                            your troubles.
                        </A>

                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/cross.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Turn Undead</H4>
                            The cleric hates the undead, they represent the antithesis of everything he stands for,
                            plus they kind of freak him out. Luckily for him, his piety gives him a certain
                            degree of power over these abominations.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="unlock">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/key.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Unlock</H4>
                            You can unlock doors with this action, this is handy if you want to walk through
                            them. The thief can unlock doors without any special equipment.
