                            Magic in <I>Godhood</I> is poorly understood at best. Even the most talented
                            wizards in the realm have been known to admit that they have very little idea
                            what they are doing. Understanding of magic is greatly hampered by the fact
                            that, while the caster can read and learn a spell at any time, he has no memory of
                            the spell once he has cast it. Wizards involved in rituals that span hours, or
                            even days, have reported finding themselves with no memory where they are, or
                            how they got there, and more importantly, no idea how to get back.
                            <P/>
                            The origins of magic are tied to the gods, who dispense their knowledge of magic
                            to mortals as they see fit. Typically a spell or item has fairly unilateral
                            applications (like really hurting someone), and the vessel has only a very
                            limited understanding of its workings anyway.
                            <P/>
                            It is possible to capture a memorized spell on paper with enough time, effort,
                            and motivation. The gods, as a group, and with some justification, view this
                            process as theft. Depending on the circumstances, their retribution can be
                            quite swift and bloody. In spite of this, there exists a thriving and well organised
                            black market in magic spells and magic items, the bread and butter of
                            wizardry.

                            To cast a spell, simply select the spell from the action list. Some spells will
                            enter the attack interface, at this point it is identical to attacking someone, as
                            described in the <A HREF="combat.html">combat</A> section. Others will work
                            instantaneously.

                            To learn a spell, you'll need to have a spellbook, you'll also need to be
                            trained in reading magic (like the magician). Alternately you can try
                            <A HREF="skills.html#pray">praying</A> to your god who, if he/she is
                            feeling in a good mood, may grant you a spell or two.

                            The following is a list of generic spells.
                            <A NAME="sleep">
                                <H5>Sleep</H5>
                                Causes the target to fall into a magical slumber.
                            </A>
                            <A NAME="magicmissile">
                                <H5>Magic Missile</H5>
                                The stock standard attack spell in a wizards arsenal, a favorite as it packs
                                a punch and it never fails to hit the target.
                            </A>
                            <A NAME="knock">
                                <H5>Knock</H5>
                                A handy spell for opening locked doors.
                            </A>
                            <A NAME="summoning">
                                <H5>Summoning</H5>
                                Summoning spells call forth a creature of some description to do the casters
                                bidding.
