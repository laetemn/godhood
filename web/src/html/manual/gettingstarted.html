                            To start a new game simply select <I>Begin Quest</I> option from the introduction
                            screen. You'll find the game starts in a room with four characters, these are the
                            fighter, thief, magician, and cleric. Each has his or her own strengths and
                            weaknesses. Just keep selecting <I>End Turn</I> until you find the character
                            that you want, then choose the <I>Enter - Portal</I> action, and the game will
                            begin.

                            There can only ever be one game in progress at a time. This means that
                            if you have saved a game, starting a new game will overwrite that game.

                            <H4>Saving a Game</H4>
                            To save a game choose the <I>System</I> action from the action menu. Typically
                            it will be the last action. This will open up the <I>System Menu</I>, to save,
                            simply select the <I>Save</I> option here. Once you have saved you'll be returned
                            to the introduction screen.

                            To load a previously saved game start <I>Godhood</I> and select
                            <I>Load Saved Game</I>, if there is a saved game in progress it will be loaded.
                            Note that loading a given saved game can only be done once, if you want to load
                            it again, you'll have to save it again.
                            <P/>
                            If your phone gets turned off in the middle of a game you should be able to
                            recover your game by selecting the <I>Load Saved Game</I> option once you've turned
                            your phone back on.

                            Sometimes you need to quit a game, maybe you've been turned into a piece of flora, or
                            perhaps you accidentally dropped the Eye of Ascension down a bottomless chasm.
                            To quit, choose the <I>System</I> action from the action menu, then select
                            <I>Quit</I>. You'll be deposited back at the introduction screen.
