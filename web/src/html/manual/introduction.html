                        <H3>Introduction</H3>
                        Welcome to <i>Godhood - The Eye of Ascension</i>, a fantasy
                        role-playing game for wireless devices.

                            In the world of <i>Godhood</i> the gods rule the earth. Worship and belief
                            can, given enough of it, turn anyone or anything into a god (or a devil). In
                            principal, it's the ultimate marriage of democracy and religion, the god you get is
                            the god you want. In reality, any group of misguided fools can suddenly open the
                            doors to godhood.

                            <H4>The Story so Far</H4>
                            The cult of Baromophet is one of the most beguiling, and hence dangerous, in the
                            known world. Followers are encouraged to partake heavily of narcotics, and
                            to indulge in wanton acts of carnality. The Baromophet cult enjoyed a brief, but
                            significant, rise to power over one thousand years ago. During this
                            time Baromophet himself was said to walk the earth, leaving a moral vacuum in
                            his wake. Many were sent against him, however those few that came back were a
                            sick parody of their original selves. If anything, the survivors were more of a
                            blow to the morale of the waning resistance than those who disappeared.
                            <P/>
                            In the end it was Baromophets own greed that destroyed him. Seeking
                            out more power, he obtained the fabled Eye of Ascension, and attempted to
                            ascend to the <I>Mantle of the Gods</I>. However the Eye consumed Baromophet
                            instead, or at least, that's the theory as both the Eye and Baromophet
                            disappeared. The cult members, robbed of their dark god, soon turned on eachother.
                            The surviving cult members were eventually driven underground, to watch, and wait.
                            <P/>
                            Now, a millenia later, the cult of Baromophet stirs again. The Eye of Ascension
                            has been located in a small temple on the outskirts of civilisation. You have been
                            sent to defend it at all costs. However as you approach your destination you notice
                            that all is not as it should be...

                            The ultimate goal of the game is to locate the Eye of Ascension and return it to
                            the level in which you start the game.
