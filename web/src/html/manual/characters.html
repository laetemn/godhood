                        <H3>Characters</H3>
                        In <i>Godhood</i> there are four characters available
                        to play.
                        <A NAME="fighter">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/fighter.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> The Fighter</H4>
                            The fighter embodies the common mans perception of what being a hero is all about.
                            He's big, he's tough, he's a hit with the ladies, and has a one-liner for every
                            situation. When he's not brutalizing his enemies, the fighter is something of
                            a people-person, and can enlist civilians through a combination of
                            rabble rousing and good, old fashioned, military-style conscription.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="mage">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/mage.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> The Magician</H4>
                            After graduating from the Academy of Magic the magician became
                            interested in the Eye of Ascension, some say to the point of obsession.
                            Now it has been discovered and he must be the first to have it,
                            it would be misused in any other fools hands.
                            <P/>
                            The magician is the only player that can read any spellbooks
                            that you happen to find lying around.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="cleric">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/priest.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> The Cleric</H4>
                            Drawn to Stutville by rumours of the Ascension, the cleric is a holy man
                            of unequaled piety. In the interests of the good of the world, not to mention
                            his own gods personal agenda, the resurection of Baromophet must be stopped
                            before it starts.
                            <P/>
                            Due to the importance of his quest, the cleric can request aid from his
                            god through prayer.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="thief">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/thief.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> The Thief</H4>
                            The thief had an epiphany at a very young age, which, if she had ever bothered to
                            put it into words, would have read something like <P/>
                            <I>"obtaining the maximum rewards for exerting the least effort, is very different to
                            exerting the least effort for the maximum rewards".</I><P/>
                            Although she keeps her profession a secret, the thief puts
                            people she meets on edge, maybe it's the wolfish grin, or the fact that she's
                            picking your pocket, but people tend to avoid her, and she prefers it that way
                            anyway.
                            <P/>
                            The thief has been known to dispatch her enemies with a single, fatal, blow.
