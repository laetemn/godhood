                        <H3>Items</H3>
                        Every adventurer should have a good understanding of the items in his possession, and
                        how to use them.
                        <A NAME="pickingup">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/pickup.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Picking Up</H4>
                            Improbable as it sounds, you will occasionally find an object lying around on
                            the ground. If fortune does bless you in this fashion you can pick it up by
                            standing above it and selecting <I>Pick Up</I> from the action menu.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="dropping">
                            <H4><IMG SRC="../images/putdown.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Dropping</H4>
                            Dropping an item is also easy, although given the notorious avarice of adventurers,
                            far less common. To drop an item, select the drop action associated with that item
                            from the action menu. For example, if you wanted to drop a <I>potion of healing</I>,
                            you would select the action labeled <I>Drop - potion of healing</I>, you should
                            notice a potion of healing sitting at your feet.
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="using">
                            <H4>Using</H4>
                            Every item in <I>Godhood</I> has a use of some description, all the actions
                            available from an item in your possession will be post-fixed with the items name.
                            For example, if I had a potion of healing, I could do two things with it,
                            specifically
                            <UL>
                                <LI>Drop - potion of healing</LI>
                                <LI>Drink - potion of healing</LI>
                            </UL>
                            I may have many potions of healing, however, since I can only drink or drop one at a
                            time, the respective options will only appear once.
                            <A NAME="fixed">
                                <H5><IMG SRC="../images/portal.png" ALIGN="baseline"/> Fixed Items</H5>
                                In your travels, you may come across items that you can't pick up, but are still
                                useful to you. By far the most common example of this type of item, is the archway
                                used to move to another room. To use a fixed item, simply stand on top of it and
                                any additional actions that that item allows will appear in the action menu.
                            </A>
                        </A>
                        <A NAME="effects">
                            <H4>Effects</H4>
                            Some items confer effects onto their owner, typically the effect will be obvious
                            based on the item. For example, a suit of armour will make make you harder to hit,
                            boots of speed will make you faster, and gauntlets of strength will make you
                            stronger.
