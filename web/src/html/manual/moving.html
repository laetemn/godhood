                        <H3>Getting Around</H3>
                        In <i>Godhood</i> you may find that you need to move from one location to another.
                        If you do find yourself in this situation, don't panic, this section will guide you
                        through the basics of perambulation.
                        <A NAME="turns">
                            <H4>Turns</H4>
                            <i>Godhood</i> is a turn-based game, this means that you can't do anything
                            (except watch helplessly) until it is your turn. The monster who is currently
                            having a turn will have its name displayed in the bottom left corner, and
                            will be standing on top of an octogram<A HREF="moving.html#octogram"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.
                            When it is your turn, you will notice a health bar, an icon indicating the mode
                            that your character is in, and a number indicating the number
                            of turn units (TUs) available to your character in the bottom left corner.<P/>

                            Every action in the game uses up a certain number of TUs, this number appears
                            in brackets at the end of the actions description. If there are not enough
                            TUs to perform an action in this turn, you'll either have to do something
                            else, or wait until your next turn by selecting <I>End Turn</I>.
                            <P/>
                            Usually your character will start his/her turn in
                            <I>Move Mode</I>, or in other words, ready to walk around.

                            Walking is, by far, the most common method of transport in the realm. To walk around
                            simply select <I>Move</I> from the menu then press a direction on your phones
                            keypad<A HREF="turn1.html#keypad"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. <P/>
                            You may notice that you can only go in four directions, but there are 8 tiles adjacent
                            to your character. To access the other four tiles press the <I>Fire</I> or <I>Game A</I>
                            key on your phone, you'll notice that the arrows in the bottom right-hand corner
                            have rotated by 45 degrees.<P/>

                            If you do happen to be a creature with the gift of flight, movement is still
                            very similar to walking, however you can also effortlessly traverse chasms as well.

                            Switching places with another monster is very handy for a lot of reasons. Firstly
                            it allows you to move a monster without it having to be that monsters turn, secondly
                            the monster that is swapping in will not be immediately attacked by any enemies in
                            the vicinity, as it would have been if it was moving normally.
                            <P>
                            You may exchange places with monsters as long as they meet the following criteria

                            <I>Godhood</I> has several rooms for you to explore. To move between them you'll need
                            to locate portal of some variety. Examples of portals include, doorways, trapdoors
                            and ladders. Portals can be identified by the downward facing arrow above them,
                            this indicates that you can enter. To use a portal, you'll need to stand directly
                            ontop of it, and select the "Enter" option.
